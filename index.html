    <p>When comparing states of different income tiers, it is clear that all four states experience a lot of the same changes year-to-year. For example, all four states experienced a decent increase in average household income between 2017 and 2018. It can also be observed there was a significant decline in personal income from 2021 to 2022, with some states experience a more drastic decrease than others.</p>
